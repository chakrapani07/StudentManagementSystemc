# Student Management System

This is simple Student Management Web Application built with Spring Boot, implementing CRUD functionality to efficiently manage student data. This project demonstrates clean architecture using Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), MySQL, and Thymeleaf for server-side rendering.

# Technologies Used

# Backend

Java
Used as the primary programming language to build the application logic, handle business operations, and implement object-oriented design principles.

Spring Boot
Provides a powerful and easy-to-configure framework for building production-ready web applications. It simplifies dependency management and speeds up development.

Spring MVC
Implements the Model–View–Controller architecture, helping structure the application cleanly by separating business logic, routing, and presentation.

Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
Used for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to interact with the MySQL database. Simplifies CRUD operations and reduces boilerplate code with repositories.

#Frontend
Thymeleaf:

Server-side template engine used to dynamically render HTML pages based on backend data, enabling seamless integration with Spring MVC.

HTML

Used to structure the content and layout of the web pages.

CSS

Applied styling to the web pages to control design, spacing, colors, and responsiveness.

Bootstrap

Used for responsive and modern UI components, ensuring the layout looks clean on all screen sizes.

Database
MySQL:

Relational database used to store and manage student information persistently. Works seamlessly with Spring Data JPA for data access.

Build & Tools
Maven

Build automation tool used to manage project dependencies, build lifecycle, and packaging of the Spring Boot application.

Eclipse IDE

Development environments used for writing, debugging, and managing the project efficiently.
